<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>PDF++ is an application built on Java that acts as a document management system
that provides some advanced features that improve the quality of life of its
users.<br>
The application has a working Graphical User Interface (GUI), built upon the
JavaFX framework, that is supplemented with a Command Line Interface (CLI)
to accept more specific requests by the User.<br>
&#160;<br>
Although not built to its final form, it boasts a large feature set such as:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Adding, Moving and Deleting Documents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assigning Custom Tags to Documents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Filtering Documents by Custom Tags.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assigning Deadlines to Documents that provide a Visual Response to the User.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Permanent Encryption and Decryption of Documents such that they require
set passwords to open even if accessed outside the application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Merging multiple documents into a single document.</p>

<p>My Enhancements to the Project Consists of:<br></p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>User Interface (UI) Transformations</strong></p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>What</strong>: The UI is the main layer of PDF++ that interacts with the End-User
of our platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Justification</strong>: The initial UI was insufficient in realising my vision
for our application. Hence through the use of the <code>FXML</code> Scripting Language and
<code>JavaFX</code> Library, I had reinvented the UI such that it would more accurately
support the application and all the additional features we had planned to add
to it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Highlights</strong>: The UI is fully compatible with the additional features of
PDF++ and would require minimal to no overhauls should any new aspects of the
application require upgrading.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Formulation and Introduction of Find Feature</strong></p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>What</strong>: The Enhanced Find feature is one of the core features that we had
planned to introduce in our application. It is a means for the target audience
to search for documents not just by their file name but also by the content
within them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Justification</strong>: Although the application was working well as a Document
Management System, analysis of the needs and wants of our target audience
was necessary. Following several informal discussions, a key feature that many
felt was lacking was the ability to easily find files that many, more powerful,
file managers were lacking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Highlights</strong> The find feature required drastic changes to the existing
<code>model</code> components as a menial version of it was already partially implemented.
As such there was key attention paid to the enhancement of the feature so as to
ensure that no other features would break because of it.</p>

<h5 id="user-interface"><a class="link" href="#user-interface">User Interface</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The UI had to include labels that displayed the Deadlines keyed in by the User
which had to reflect the duration to the due date by changing colours. The UI
also needed to have a default <em>Welcome Screen</em> that served as a central
dashboard to the User.<br>
Furthermore, the dashboard had to be replaced with a details screen when the
User interacted with one of the Files in our application.<br>
These requirements meant that the UI had to heavily communicate with the
<code>logic</code> and <code>model</code> systems in the backend to produce the required behaviours.<br>

easily follow through the usage of the feature as well as understanding its capabilities.

<p>When the user enters the CLI Input for the find command, the command is first passed
from the <code>LogicManager</code> to the <code>PdfBookParser</code> will carry out the following steps.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The user inputs a request to <code>find</code> a keyword within the files of the application.
e.g. <code>find keyword</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>PdfBookParser</code> creates a new <code>FindCommandParser</code> upon recognising that the user
wishes to use the <code>find</code> feature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parse method within the <code>FindCommandParser</code> would create a <code>NameContainsKeywordPredicate</code> which will allow
the <code>Model</code> to filter its list of files to show the user the requested files.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Upon receiving the <code>FindCommand</code> from the <code>PdfBookParser</code> the following steps are carried out.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The <code>execute</code> method is invoked from the <code>LogicManager</code> with the parameters of <code>model</code> and <code>history</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>model</code> then uses the <code>NameContainsKeywordPredicate</code> and runs the <code>test</code> method to check each file and
verify that it fulfils the predicate. This is so that the <code>model</code> can update itself to present the list of
files that the user wishes to view.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>test</code> method invokes classes from the external <a href="https://pdfbox.apache.org/index.html">Apache PDFBox</a> library, namely <code>PDDocument</code> and
<code>PDFTextStripper</code> to extract the contents of the existing files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The extracted content is then checked to verify if it contains the <code>keyword</code> input by the user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Further checks are also done to confirm if each file&#8217;s name contains the <code>keyword</code> as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>model</code> then updates itself and stores the current action in the <code>history</code> object.</p>

<h6 id="considerations"><a class="link" href="#considerations">Considerations</a></h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our application also implements several security features such as the ability of users to <code>Encrypt</code> and
<code>Decrypt</code> their files. Hence, a major security concern was to prevent the <code>FindCommand</code> from searching
through the contents of files that are previously encrypted. This is crucial to prevent the leakage of data
as malicious users might simply utilize the <code>FindCommand</code> to extract information from the tracked files.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="future-implementation"><a class="link" href="#future-implementation">Future Implementation</a></h6>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The main issue with the current implementation of the <code>FindCommand</code> is its slow speeds with respect to
large files or files that contain a large string of text files. Hence, a possible consideration you might
wish to improve upon is to "upgrade" this feature by improving its speed of this feature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yet another enhancement to this feature you might wish to implement is the use of Optical Image Recognition,
otherwise known as OCR. This will allow the application to translate images within the file to words which would further
improve the ability of the application to look through content even if they are images.</p>
