<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our team was tasked with enhancing
<a href="https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4">this addressbook</a>
for our Software Engineering Project. We made the decision to morph it into a personalized file manager,
<strong><em>PDF&#43;&#43;</em></strong>. Inspired by applications that bring an upgrade to the atypical solution like
<strong><em>Notepad&#43;&#43;</em></strong>, we wanting to make an application relevant for students.
This application allows you to set datelines and tags for files, with managing PDFs as
its main specialty. It is mainly a CLI (Command Line Interface) application i.e. commands are executed
through typing the desired command in the input line provided. However, several commands also allow for
input through a GUI (Graphical User Interface), where the user is able to click on the desired input.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Description: I added the ability to append two of more PDF files within the
application to so that a new file is created with the merged content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: Merging PDF files is highly utilised, especially by students or
users handling numerous documentations. However, merging of PDF files is usually a
service provided by paid versions of PDF managers or other external online services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlight: Merging can be done quickly through the application, without the
inconvenience of relying on other software and online services to do it.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Description: Based on the originial ability of
<a href="https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4">addressbook</a> to find files based on name fully matching search keyword,
I added the ability to find files based on partial matching of file name, as well as matching of any text content within the file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: <strong><em>PDF&#43;&#43;</em></strong> is intended to be complete replacement for managing files. For finding a file on most other
filesystems, the full name of the file is not required, hence it should also be made the same for the application. Additionally, users
should be able to find for files based on the content, which can be helpful in refine the scope of the search and make it more accurate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlight: Similar to a Google search engine, finding of files becomes faster!</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Description: I added the ability to move files within the application to any permissible directory
within the user&#8217;s local device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: <strong><em>PDF&#43;&#43;</em></strong> is intended to be complete replacement for managing files. The user
should be able to perform all the desired actions regarding file management through the application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlight: When moving a file to a deeply nested directory, it is much more convenient as compared to
manually navigating to the directory to move the file.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="big"><code>filter</code></span> command</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Description: I added the ability to filter files within the application based on the file tag(s) specified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: For files that are tagged, it is necessary to have a means to use the tags as identification - if not
then tags would be purely aesthetic!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlight: Filtering files by tag allows you to group files strategically within the application, which would make file
management much more convenient.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="big"><code>delete</code></span> command optimisation</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Description: Based on the original ability of
<a href="https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4">addressbook</a> to delete files recorded within the application (but not actually deleting
he file from the local filesystem), I upgraded it so that there is an option for the user to delete the file both from
the application as well as from the local filesystem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: <strong><em>PDF&#43;&#43;</em></strong> is intended to be complete replacement for managing files. From a user perspective,
the intention behind deleting a file might be to remove the file completely. Otherwise, the user might encounter additional
inconvenience e.g. deleting a file to create a new file of the same name, only to be unable to because the old file is still
physically present.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlight: There is flexibility in how you want to delete a file from the application, as well as the convenience of using CLI which
has the potential to be faster than clicking on the file directly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="big"><code>sort</code></span> command optimisation</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Description: Based on the original ability of
<a href="https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4">addressbook</a> to sort the files based on ascending order of name, I upgraded
it so that the user can specify if the sort should be done in ascending or descending order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: It is an implicit requirement that sorting features should have the flexibility for sorting to be done in either
ascending or descending order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlight: Sorting ability becomes more robust and gives the user the flexbility to sort as desired.</p>

<p>The <code>merge</code> feature is facilitated by both <strong>MergeCommand</strong> and <strong>MergeCommandParser</strong>.
This feature utilises the

<a href="https://pdfbox.apache.org/docs/2.0.1/javadocs/org/apache/pdfbox/multipdf/PDFMergerUtility.html"><em>PDFMergerUtility</em></a>
API to append two or more PDFs and create a new file with the merged content. As there will be one
additional file added to the application, this feature also implicitly performs the <span class="big"><code>add</code></span> feature to add the new
PDF to the application.</p>

<p><span class="big"><strong>Considerations</strong></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The default directory of the merged file is currently set to the directory of the first index of the files to be merged. There were considerations to make flexibility in the merge command input
to allow for the user to specify the desired directory of the merged file. As the current version of <strong><em>PDF++</em></strong> is focused on a working product, it was decided to simplify the command to focus on
the merge operation. Users can also make use of <span class="big"><code>move</code></span> feature to move the file; such implementation is more intuitive if the user is going to be using the application for everyday needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the merging of files, the current implementation involves adding all files to a single <a href="https://pdfbox.apache.org/docs/2.0.1/javadocs/org/apache/pdfbox/multipdf/PDFMergerUtility.html"><em>PDFMergerUtility</em></a>
to merge together. One alternative to merging multiple files would be to create a separate <strong>PDFMergerUtility</strong> for every pair of files and merge the content recursively into a final merged file. The
advantage of this would be better stability in performance when merging multiple large files as there will be lesser workload on each <strong>PDFMergerUtility</strong>. However, this would undoubtedly cause the performance
to be slower as more merge operations are done overall. As the case of instability occurs only in very large files, it was decided to go with focus on performance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="big"><strong>Future Implementation</strong></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are performance issues encountered when performing the merge operations with many files of large size. In future versions, the merge operation has to not only ensure
performance but stability as well. By v2.0, the merging will be able to support larger files without any concern for the application to freeze or crash while merging.
Currently, there are no means to make the merging operation perform faster due to the merging operation being performed through the
<a href="https://pdfbox.apache.org/docs/2.0.1/javadocs/org/apache/pdfbox/multipdf/PDFMergerUtility.html"><em>PDFMergerUtility</em></a> API.</p>

<p>Step 4: The <strong>MergeCommand</strong> is then executed. The new name of the merged file follows the format: "merged[hashcode].pdf",
