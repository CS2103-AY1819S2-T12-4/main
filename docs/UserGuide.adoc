== Introduction

=== PDF++ ?

PDF++ is a desktop application that is meant for anyone who wants or needs a convenient tool that helps you manage all the documents in your computer.
This application can be used by both *Text Input (TI)* and a Graphical *User Interface (GUI)*
hence, both technical users and casual users can enjoy a comfortable experience using our program. All features provided by our application can be used via the *TI* and relevant feedback, based on your command, will be displayed in the Response Area of the application.

[NOTE]
The current version of PDF++ supports PDF documents only. However, it is projected
to support for all file types in the future.

=== Proper Usage of PDF++
As PDF++ aims to replace your existing File Management System, all operations should be done
through the application. In order to ensure smooth user experience, you should not perform any
operation, such as removing, renaming or replacing, on the files that was previously added into
the application outside of the application.

Furthermore, due to the properties of the Operating Systems, no operation can be performed on the
files that are opened. Please ensure that your files are not opened before executing the command.

This File Management System plans to enhance your typical experience managing your documents and
it strives to be the last document manager you will ever need. It includes a multitude of
functions in elevating your PDF reading and management experience. There are many features offered by our application that you can refer to in the table of contents on the left side of this screen with many more to come! Are you fascinated by PDF++? What are you waiting for?
Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `pdfplusplus.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your PDF++.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

== Features

CAUTION: Please ensure that you have the permissions to Read, Write and
Execute the files that you wish to manage through our application. Please use
a web search, like Google, to assist you in identifying if you possess the
permissions. If you are lacking these permissions our application may not be
able to carry out the actions specified by you.

WARNING: Please do not manipulate the files once you have added them to our
application. Unforeseen actions such as moving, renaming and others might result
in unexpected behaviour by the application. Our application is meant to replace
the need for you to perform these actions manually on your files yourselves.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the additional information that you need to input e.g. in `add f/FILENAME`, `FILENAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add f/myfile`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times or zero times e.g. `t/TAG...` can be left blank or used multiple times, `t/TagA t/TagB t/TagC` etc.
* ALL Commands are to be entered in the Input Area that is highlighted in Orange.
* ALL Responses to your input Commands will be displayed in the Output area that is highlighted in blue.
====
=== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help` +
The help command displays this current page for any references you may need or questions that you may require answers to.

=== Importing a file: `add`

The add command allows you to add a file through TI into to the application, or through the GUI. +
The added file will appear in the Files Section, highlighted in green, shown above. +

NOTE: Files with the same name can be added to our application provided that
they are not in the same directory. Just as any Operating System would allow the
existence of files with the same name in different directories.

The Add feature has the following syntax:

[.big]#`add`#

[.big]#`add f/<PATH_TO_FILE> t/<TAG>...`#

* `f/` refers to the command immediately following after this prefix is a file
* `<PATH_TO_FILE>` refers to the path to the `Pdf` you wish to add
* `<TAG>...` refers to the new `Tag` you wish to add. Leave this portion empty if you
do not wish to tag this file.
* Entering `add` without `<INDEX>` or  `<NEWDIRECTORY>` will open the default file
selection GUI for the user to add the file directly.

[NOTE]
Please ensure that you have entered the full `PATH_TO_FILE`. Please refer to
`Step-by-Step Guide -- add` below for detailed explanation.

==== Feature breakdown
Illustrated below is a sample usage scenario that provides a clear view to the inner
workings of the Add feature.

Step 1: The user launches the application with either an existing set of `Pdf` or a new
sample set of `Pdf` stored within as shown below.

image::AddFeatureStep1Default.png[width="600"]

Step 2: The user navigates to the folder with the file and copy the directory.

* __For Windows__
Once the user has navigated to the folder, click on the address bar and copy

image::AddFeatureStep2CopyDirectory.png[width="600"]

* __For Mac__

Step 3: The user enters the `add` command into the CLI interface, following the
outlined syntax as illustrated below.

[NOTE]
Your users must type the file name **after** the directory copied at __Step 2__

image::AddFeatureStep3UserInput.png[width="600"]

[NOTE] you can enter `add` and hit enter, to open up a GUI for you to select the file you
wish to add.

Step 4: Upon hitting enter to execute the command, the *AddCommandParser* parses the input
into several components that are required to be executed by the *AddCommand*.

Upon parsing, the parser then creates a new *AddCommand* that will be executed according to
the your input.

Step 5: Upon receiving the necessary information from the parser, the `AddCommand` first
begins by checking for validity as shown below.

* Duplicate `Pdf` found in PDF++

image::AddFeatureStep5DuplicateFound.png[width="600"]

* `Pdf` does not exist in directory

image::AddFeatureStep5PdfNotFound.png[width="600"]

* `Pdf` found and no duplication in PDF++

image::AddFeatureStep5Sucess.png[width="600"]

Step 6: If the validity check and the individual property check passes, the file is then
added to PDF++

[NOTE]
As of v1.2, the Add feature is only capable of adding 1 `Pdf` file at a time. By v2.0,
the feature will support adding multiple files.

* The file must be a PDF file (with .pdf extension).

Example:

* `add f/C:\Users\Raj\Documents\Tutorial3.pdf` [Windows Operating System]
* `add f//Users/raj/Desktop/CS2101 Lecture.pdf` [Mac / Linux Operating System]
* `add` [Any Operating System]

=== Listing all files : `list`

The list command shows you a list of all files that are tracked by the application. +
The files will be displayed in the Files Section of the application, highlighted in green. +

Format: `list`

=== Sorting all files : `sort`

The sort command allows you to sort all the files in the application based on the input criteria. +
Hence you may be able to, for example, sort the files by their name in ascending or descending order. +

Format: `sort CRITERIA ORDER`

****
* CRITERIA: `name`, `deadline`, `size`. +
* ORDER: `up` or `down` corresponding to an ascending or descending order
****

Example:

* `sort name up` +
* `sort deadline down` +
* `sort size up` +

=== Opening a file : `open`

The open command allows you to open an existing file, specified by the index of the file that is next to the name of the file in the Files Section, highlighted in green. +
The selected file will then be opened with any application that you have set as the default for +
your computer. +

Format: `open INDEX`

Example:

* `open 3` +

=== Renaming a file : `rename`

The rename command allows you to change the name of a file, specified by thr index of the file that is next to the name of the file in the Files Section, highlighted in green. +

The rename command has the following syntax:

[.big]#`rename <INDEX> n/<NEWNAME> t/<NEWTAG1>...`#

* `<INDEX>` refers to the index of the file that you wish to edit.
* `n/` indicates that you are editing the name of the file
* `<NEWNAME>` refers to the new value that you would like to set the file _Name_ to.
* `<NEWTAG...>` refers to the new _Tag_ you wish to add. Leave this portion empty if you
do not wish to tag this file.

Example:
* `rename 1 n/newname.pdf`

****
* NAME: Must end with `.pdf` +
* NAME: Must be a name that your Operating System deems valid.
* OUTPUT: If the rename is invalid, our application will notify you in the output area, +
highlighted in blue.
****

[NOTE]
The index value can be referenced from the list in the main application, or from the
result of the `Filter`, `Find` or `List` feature.

==== Feature Breakdown
Step 1: The user launches an application with either an existing set of `Pdf` or a
new sample set of `Pdf` stored within as shown below.

image::EdiFeatureStep1Default.png[width="600"]

Step 2: The user chooses a `Pdf` that they wish to edit, in this case `g.pdf`, and
enters the `rename` command into the CLI Interface, following the outlined Syntax as
illustrated below.

image::EditFeatureUserInput.png[width="600"]

Step 3: Upon hitting enter to execute the command, the *EditCommandParser* parses
the input into relevant objects that are required to be executed by the *EditCommand*
object. Upon parsing, the parser then creates a new *EditCommand* that will execute the
user's input.

Step 4: Upon receiving the necessary information from the parser, the *EditCommand* first
begins by checking for validity as shown below.

image::EditFeatureNoDuplicate.png[width="700"]

image::EditFeatureDuplicate.png[width="700"]

Step 5: If the validity check and the individual property check passes, the file is then
effectively renamed within PDF++ and in the actual directory, thus resulting in an output
as shown below.

image::EditFeatureFinalOutput.png[width="600"]

[NOTE]
As of V1.2, the Edit Feature removes any existing `Tag` s and replaces them with those
input by the user (If any). By `V1.4` The user will be able to select tags he wishes
to remove or add.

=== Tagging a file : `tag`

The tag command allows you to add or remove a tag to a file, specified by the index of the file that is next to the name of the file in the Files Section, highlighted in green. +
The prefixes `-a` refers to "add" and `-r` refers to "remove". +

Format: `tag INDEX -a [t/TAG]...` [To add a tag] +
Format: `tag INDEX -r [t/TAG]...` [To remove a tag]

Example:

* `tag 1 -a t/CS2103T t/SE`
* `tag 2 -r t/tutorials`

****
* TAG: Tags must be a continuous word without spaces
* TAG: Can only contain alphanumeric characters.
* TAG: You can only remove a tag that you have previously added.
****

=== Deleting a file : `delete`

The delete command lets you to delete a file from the application and/or your computer. +
In order to delete the file completely from the computer, you must specify the `hard` parameter to the `delete` command.
The file that is to be deleted must be specified by the index of the file that is next to the name of the file in the Files Section, highlighted in green. +

Format: `delete INDEX`
Format: `delete INDEX hard`

Example:

* `delete 4` +
* `delete 3 hard` +

=== Moving a file : `move`

The move command allows you to move a file, specified by the index of the file that is next to the name of the file in the Files Section, highlighted in green. +
The file can be moved from its current directory on your computer to another directory on your computer. +
The move file also has a User Interface Option to allow for an easier file moving experience. +

Format: `move INDEX d/DIRECTORY`

Example:

* `move 1 d/C:\User\Jeremy\Downloads` [Windows Operating System]
* `move 1 d//Users/jet/Documents/Important` [Mac / Linux Operating System]
* `move 1` [Any Operating System]

=== Exiting the program : `exit`

This command lets you exit the program. +
Format: `exit`

=== Retrieving information about a file: `select`

Select a file to see a more information about file.

Alternatively, clicking the file in the Files Section, highlighted in green, allows you to view more information pertaining to that file. +
This information will be displayed in the Upcoming Deadlines Area, highlighted in red. +

Format: `select INDEX`

Example: `select 3`

=== Setting a deadline for the file : `deadline`

Set or remove a deadline for the a file, specified by the index of the file that is next to the name of the file in the Files Section, highlighted in green. +
A file's deadline is located under its name and has 4 colours to indicate the amount of time you have before it is due. +

The colour Green, indicates that there is more `7` days till the deadline is due, as shown below. +

image::UGDeadlineFar.png[width="300"]

The colour Orange, indicates that you have `7` or less days till it is due. As shown below. +

image::UGDeadlineNear.png[width="300"]

The colour Red, indicates that you have reached or failed to complete the task by the due date, as shown below +

image::UGDeadlineDue.png[width="300"]

The colour Blue indicates that you have completed the set task. +

image::UGDeadlineDone.png[width='300']

All deadlines are also displayed in the Deadlines Section of the application highlighted by Red. +

Format: `deadline INDEX date/DATE` [To Set a Deadline] +
Format: `deadline INDEX done` [To Complete a Deadline] +
Format: `deadline INDEX remove` [To remove a Deadline] +

Examples:

* `deadline 1 date/20-02-2019` +
* `deadline 1 done` +
* `deadline 1 remove` +

WARNING: The date must be in the format of dd-mm-yyyy. +

=== Filter files by tags: `filter`

The filter command shows you only the files that contain the tags specified in the `filter` command. +

Format: `filter t/TAG...`

Examples:

* `filter t/JobApplication` +
* `filter t/Lecture t/Week10`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `lecture` will match `LECTURE`
* The order of the tags does not matter. e.g. `Lecture Week_1` will match `Week_1 Lecture`
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Urgent` will not match `UrgentFiles`
* File matching at least one keyword will be returned
****

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== File Protection: `encrypt` & `decrypt`
The command `encrypt` allow you to lock your files such that they cannot be accessed without a password that you had specified. Similarly, the command `decrypt` will let you remove the password that you had set for the file.

Format: `encrypt INDEX password/PASSWORD` [To Encrypt a file] +
Format: `decrypt INDEX password/PASSWORD` [To Decrypt a file] +

Examples:

* `encrypt 2 password/ThisIsNotASecurePassword`
* `decrypt 2 password/ThisIsNotASecurePassword`

For encryption, you can select the file on the list that you wish to encrypt
with a password you specified. Likewise, for decryption, you have to enter the
password of the encrypted file that you wish to decrypt.

The Encrypt and Decrypt feature has the following syntax:

Encryption: `encrypt INDEX password/PASSWORD`

Decryption: `decrypt INDEX password/PASSWORD`

* `INDEX` refers to the index of the file on the list that you wish to encrypt/decrypt
* `password/` refers to the command immediately following after this prefix is the password
of the file

* `PASSWORD` refers to the password you wish to encrypt your file with / of the encrypted file
you want to decrypt.

[NOTE]
Please ensure that you have entered the correct password as undo & redo functions do not work
with encrypt & decrypt.

Please refer to `Step-by-Step Guide -- encrypt` for encryption guide and `Step-by-Step Guide --
decrypt` for decryption guide.

==== Step-by-Step Guide -- encrypt
Illustrate below is a sample usage scenario that provides a clear view to the inner workings
of the Encrypt feature.

Step 1: The user launches the application with either an existing set of `Pdf` or a new
sample set of `Pdf` stored within as shown below. Please refer to <<Add feature>> for guide
in how you can add your files into PDF++.

image::EncryptFeatureStep1Default.png[width="600"]

Step 2: You select the file that you wish to encrypt via the INDEX on the list.

image::EncryptFeatureStep2Index.png[width="600"]

Step 3: Enter the `encrypt` command into the CLI interface, following the outlined syntax as
illustrated below.

image::EncryptFeatureStep3UserInput.png[width="600"]

Step 4: Upon hitting enter to execute the command, the `EncryptCommandParser` parses the input
into several components that are required to be executed by the `EncryptCommand`.

Upon parsing, the parser then creates a new `EncryptCommand` that will be executed according
to your input.

Step 5: Upon receiving the necessary information from the parser, which includes the INDEX and
PASSWORD, the `EncryptCommand` first checks if the INDEX is valid.

* `INDEX` is invalid or out of bound.

image::EncryptFeatureStep5InvalidIndex.png[width="600"]

* `INDEX` and `PASSWORD` are both valid. The file you selected will be encrypted with the
password you specified.

image::EncryptFeatureStep5Sucess.png[width="600"]

Step 6: If the command passes the validity check, the file you have selected is encrypted.
You can open your file to see the result. Please refer to <<Open feature>> for the `open` feature.



==== Step-by-Step Guide -- decrypt
Illustrate below is a sample usage scenario that provides a clear view to the inner workings
of the Decrypt feature.

[TIP]
`decrypt` feature is very similar to `encrypt` feature.

Step 1: The user launches the application with either an existing set of `Pdf` or a new
sample set of `Pdf` stored within as shown below. Please refer to <<Add feature>> for guide
in how you can add your files into PDF++.

image::DecryptFeatureStep1Default.png[width="600"]

Step 2: You select the file that you wish to decrypt via the INDEX on the list.

image::DecryptFeatureStep2Index.png[width="600"]

Step 3: Enter the `decrypt` command into the CLI interface, following the outlined syntax as
illustrate below.

image::DecryptFeatureStep3UserInput.png[width="600"]

Step 4: Upon hitting enter to execute the command, the `DecryptCommandParser` parses the input
into several components that are required to be executed by the `DecryptCommand`.

Upon parsing, the parser then creates a new `DecryptCommand` that will be executed according
to your input.

Step 5: Upon receiving the necessary information from the parser, which includes the INDEX and
PASSWORD, the `DecryptCommand` first checks if the INDEX is valid.

* `INDEX` is invalid or out of bound.

image::DecryptFeatureStep5InvalidIndex.png[width="600"]

* `PASSWORD` is invalid
[NOTE]
Please enter the password of the encrypted file. You will not be able to decrypt the file
without the password.

image::DecryptFeatureStep5InvalidPassword.png[width="600"]

* `INDEX` and `PASSWORD` are both valid. The file you selected will be decrypted with the
password you specified.

image::DecryptFeatureStep5Sucess.png[width="600"]

Step 6: If the command passes the validity check, the file you have selected is decrypted.
You can open your file to see the result. Please refer to <<Open feature>> for the `open` feature.



// end::dataencryption[]

=== Merging Files: `merge`
With the `merge` command , you can merge two or more files into a new single file.

The Merge feature has the following syntax:

[.big]#`merge <INDEX1> <INDEX2> ...`#

* `<INDEX>` refers to the index of the `Pdf` that you wish to merge.
* Minimum of two indices have to be provided for the merge to be performed, up to as many
indices as desired.
* It is possible to repeat an index; the PDF would simply merge with a copy of itself.

[NOTE]
The index value can be referenced from the list in the main application, or from the
result of the `Filter`, `Find` or `List` feature.

==== Feature breakdown
Illustrated below is a sample usage scenario that provides a clear view to the inner
workings of the `merge` feature.

Step 1: From the main interface of the application, the user chooses the file(s) that
they wish to merge, and enters the `merge` command into the CLI Interface, following
the outlined Syntax as illustrated below.

image::MergeFeatureStep1.png[width="600"]

Step 2: After executing the command, the *MergeCommandParser* parses the input into
relevant objects that are required to be executed by the *MergeCommand* object. In
particular, it ensures that there are two or more arguments passed as described in the
above Syntax. Upon parsing, the parser then creates a new *MergeCommand* that will execute
the user's input.

In this case, the above two files will be merged, with the _"CS2103T_PDF++_UG_Intro.pdf"_
file appended behind the other file.

Step 3: The *MergeCommand* is then executed. During the execution, there are several levels
of validation that, failing which would stop the execution and throw an exception.
Here are the different cases:

Step 4: Successful execution of the command would return a *CommandResult* object and create the
a new file with the merged content. The new name of the merged file follows the format: "merged[hashcode].pdf". This is to ensure
unique file name. The hashcode in the name will be modified if name already exists.

Examples:

* `merge 1 2 3`
* `merge 1 2 1`
* `merge 1 1`

[NOTE]
If the combined file size is > 100MB, the operation will take more than a minute to execute. Please
give the application some time to completely execute the operation.

****
* A minimum of 2 files must be specified by their indexes
* The same file can be merged with itself, hence creating a new file that is composed of the same file twice.
* The newly created file will be stored in the directory of the `INDEX` that was first specified.
****
