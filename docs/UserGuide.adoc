== Introduction

PDF++ is a desktop application that targets students who are looking for a file manager in organising their PDF files.
This application integrates both Command Line Interface (CLI) and Graphical User Interface (GUI)
to provide an unique experience for you. All supported features can be performed via the CLI and
relevant feedback, based on your command, will be shown via the GUI.

This manager plans to enhance your typical experience managing PDF files.
It strives to be the last PDF manager you ever need. It includes a multitude of
functions in elevating your PDF reading and management experience. These functions
include: set deadlines, tagging, label pages, zoom-in view, password, easy transfer,
search - and much more to come! Are you fascinated by PDF++? What are you waiting for?
