== [underline]#Introduction#
Welcome to my Project Portfolio. This document provides you with an
overview


{uri-pdfplusplus}[((PDF++))]

== [underline]#About PDF++#

=== Why PDF++?
// Background info
Most university students have one thing in common, messy desktop.
As a student, I have to manage multiple new documents weekly.
Furthermore, each file is categorised differently or has different unique purpose.
For instance, I would look for files from my programming modules on certain algorithm
concepts or look from my language module for files with writing tips. However, current
File Management System (FMS), such as File Explorer in Windows, has its limitations
in the categorisation of files. Even for organised users, it is ineffective to
make a constant effort maintaining the documents in an orderly manner, and inefficient
switching between folders to look for the files of their interest. My team and I
recognised this limitation and decided to work on building an elaborated FMS, PDF++.

=== Project Scope
//Project scope
For the team project, we were provided with an existing {uri-addressbook}[AddressBook]
application. We decided to morph the application into PDF++, a sophisticated FMS
targeting students who prefer working with command line interface (CLI). However,
given the limitation of the project, our application currently supports PDF
files only, and thus the name.

=== Main role and contributions
// main role and contributions
I am one of the {uri-aboutus}[developers] for PDF++ that in charge of
implementing {uri-fileprotection}[*File Protection*] feature and most of the
test cases for the Logic component.

// description - what were my tasks, what I did do to meet task requirements
For File Protection feature, I have incorporated both `encrypt` and
`decrypt` features

=== [underline]#2. Summary of contributions#

This section highlights my key contributions to the documentation, coding and
technical aspects for the PDF++ project.

==== [underline]#Robust File Protection System#

PDF++ not only supports several essential features, such as {uri-add}[add] and
{uri-open}[open] features, it also has a built-in sophisticated
{uri-fileprotection}[File Protection System] (FPS).

For File Protection System, I have incorporated both `encrypt` and
`decrypt` features and other improvements that enforces the security of the application.


* `Encrypt` command allows users to protect their PDF files that is in the application.





Format: `Encrypt INDEX password/PASSWORD`

Examples:

* Valid Examples:
** Encrypt 1 password/anyValidPassword

* Invalid Examples:
** Encrypt -1 password/anyValidPassword (invalid password)
** Encrypt 1 password/ (no password specified)


* `Decrypt` command allows users to remove the password of their protected PDF files

==== [underline]#Test Cases for Logic Component#
The challenges faced and how I contributed in reviewing the code and suggested
fixes to bugs found in code
