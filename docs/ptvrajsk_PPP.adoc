== Introduction

This document provides a detailed description to my contributions to
the several projects that I have been a part of over the years. +
My contributions will be substantiated with relevant technical application
and sources, if possible.

== PROJECT: PDF++

PDF++ is an application built on Java that acts as a document management system
that provides some advanced features that improves the quality of life of its
users. +
The application has a working Graphical User Interface (GUI), built upon the
JavaFX framework, that is supplemented with a Command Line Interface (CLI)
to accept more specific requests by the User. +
{nbsp} +

Although not built to its final form, it boasts a large feature set such as:

- Adding, Moving and Deleting Documents.
- Assigning Custom Tags to Documents.
- Filtering Documents by Custom Tags.
- Assigning Deadlines to Documents that provide a Visual Response to the User.
- Permanent Encryption and Decryption of Documents such that they require
set passwords to open even if accessed outside the application.
- Merging multiple documents into a single document.

=== Contributions

The following are some of my contributions to this project:

==== Dynamic User Interface (UI)

Through the use of JavaFX and the FXML Scripting Language, I had upgraded the
initial UI that was lacking several key features that were crucial for our
application. +
{nbsp} +
The UI had to include labels that displayed the Deadlines keyed in by the User
which had to reflect the duration to the due date by changing colours. The UI
also needed to have a default _Welcome Screen_ that served as a central
dashboard to the User. +
Furthermore, the dashboard had to be replaced with a details screen when the
User interacted with one of the Files in our application. +
{nbsp} +
The scripted UI is attached below:

The deadline feature is an integral part of our application and is one of the
major features that was advertised to stand out. +
